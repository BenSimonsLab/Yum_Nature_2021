Fortran programme crypt_neutral.f makes a least-square fit to the experimental
clone size distrtibution as presented in Extended Data Fig. 3a-c.

yfpcontrol.dat contains YFP+ clone size data for confetti control 

yfpkrasremote.dat contains YFP+ clone size data for YFP+ clones in crypts
remote from mutant crypts in red2kras mice

yfppi3kremote.dat contains YFP+ clone size data for YFP+ clones in crypts
remote from mutant crypts in red2pi3k mice

For all data sets, first column is day 4, second is day 7, third is day 14,
and fourh is day 21.

The code crypt_neutral.f must be adjusted according to the chosen data set.

Sample outputs are contained in:

average_optimal.dat - average clone size (experiment and fit)

dist_optimal.dat - clone size distribution comprising experiment with error
bars and theoretical fit

cdist_optimal.dat - cumulative clone size distribution containing experiment
with error bars and theoretical fit

lsq.dat - contains least-square values for parameter set - read out by
mathematica code YFP_controls.nb

Fortran programme crypt_imbalance.f makes a least-square fit to the experimental
clone size distrtibution as presented in Extended Data Fig. 3d-f.

kras.dat contains RFP+ clone size data for mutant clones in red2kras mice

pi3k.dat contains RFP+ clone size data for mutant clones in red2pi3k mice

n1.dat contains RFP+ clone size data for mutant clones in red2notch mice

For all data sets, first column is day 4, second is day 7, third is day 14,
and fourh is day 21.

The code crypt_imbalance.f must be adjusted according to the chosen data set
and the time offset (dt0). Optimal values are shown in Supplementary theory.

Sample outputs are contained in:

average_optimal.dat - average clone size (experiment and fit)

dist_optimal.dat - clone size distribution comprising experiment with error
bars and theoretical fit

cdist_optimal.dat - cumulative clone size distribution containing experiment
with error bars and theoretical fit

lsq.dat - contains least-square values for parameter set - read out by
mathematica code mutant.nb
